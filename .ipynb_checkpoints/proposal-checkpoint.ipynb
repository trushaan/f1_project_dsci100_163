    "Winemaking is a large global industry, with over 330 billion USD worth of wine sold in 2020. Cheap wine is around 15 USD / bottle, with more expensive ones fetching 500 USD+. Wine price is dictated partly by its quality, which is linked to factors like sugar content, acidity, alcohol content, and more. We would like to ask: can we predict the quality of a wine based on some of its intrinsic qualities? If so, which ones make the best predictors of overall quality. We begin by reading in a dataset about red wines."

Human taste is ultimately the key aspect of determining whether a wine is high quality, but if quality is predicted by chemical properties alone, it could lead to breakthroughs in the winemaking industry. If successful, such a predictive model can have large implications in the industry, as the information could be used by winemakers to understand how they can produce higher quality wine, and rake in more profit. This could lead to the integration of modern chemical techniques and engineering with winemaking to revolutionize a craft that has been around for thousands of years.\n"

    "Looking at the visualizations from our classifier output provides much more insight than the percent accuracy value. Looking at figures 5a and 5b, the overall shape and distribution of quality seems quite similar. The main noticeable difference being the spike of wines at 0.75 acidity with a predicted quality of 7 actually have a quality rating of 6. So while the classifier gave an incorrect prediction, the predictions were not far off. This pattern is seen in all of the other graphs as well. Comparing the prediction graphs in the left column with the graphs with the actual quality shown by the graphs in the right column, the graphs take oon similar shapes, and most of the differences vary by 1 quality point. In a small number of cases where true quality is at the extremes of the scale (a 3 or an 8) the predictive model may have given it a rating 2 points away from its actual (seen in figure 5e and 5f). This provides some more context behind the predictive ability of our classifier, showing that while the quality rating was predicted perfectly 62% of the time, a majority of the incorrect predictions were only 1 point away from the true value.\n",

    "With this infirmation in mind, it seems like the classification model is able to make a fairly accurate prediction about the quality of a certain wine. Such a classifier could be of great use to winemakers, allowing them to see wine quality by taking measurements during the winemaking process. Based on the information produced by the classifier, winemakers may then make decisions about how they cal alter the winemaking process to produce higher quality wine."
